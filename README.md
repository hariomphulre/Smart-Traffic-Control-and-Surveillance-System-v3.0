## üß† Problem Statement

‚ûî **Real world traffic problem:** Due to exponential growth of vehicles, traffic increasing day by day and  Conventional traffic signal systems rely on fixed timers or rudimentary sensors, leading to inefficiencies such as prolonged congestion, fuel waste, and increased emissions.

‚ûî **Raising Traffic Violations:** Helmet-less riding, signal jumping, and triple riding are rampant in many cities. Manual enforcement is ineffective and resource-intensive. Our system automatically detects violations using machine learning (YOLO model), improving enforcement efficiency.

‚ûî **Emergency Response Delays:** Congestion and poor traffic flow slow down emergency vehicles. By monitoring real-time traffic, the system can be scaled to prioritize emergency vehicle movement and dynamically manage signals.

‚ûî **Lack of Centralized Data:** Current systems don‚Äôt store violation data for easy access or reporting. Our solution uploads detected violations to the cloud, enabling officials to track offenders via license plate recognition and access reports through a web interface.

## ‚úÖ Approach & Solution

‚û¢ Deploy Raspberry Pi with camera modules at traffic signals to capture real-time video using edge computing.  

‚û¢ Use custom-trained YOLOv11 model for vehicle detection and classification (bike, car, bus, truck), directly on edge devices.  

  - Helmet, Speed, Emergency vehicle, Red light violation detection.  
  - Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) with EasyOCR and Google Cloud Vision API.  

‚û¢ Develop an algorithm to control traffic signals dynamically by:

  - Prioritizing high density traffic with dynamic countdown.
  - Prioritizing emergency vehicles by granting immediate green signals.

‚û¢ Securely upload all surveillance data including vehicle images, license plates, speed, helmet status, and violations to cloud storage and a web platform in real-time via RESTful APIs.

‚û¢ Build a web platform with features like:

  - Real-time analytics and filteration option by state and city.

  - Vehicle number plate search bar for detailed info. (logs, images, and top recorded stats).

  - Automated challan (fine) generation system for violations.

  - Live map displaying traffic signals, traffic density, and countdown timers.

  - Advanced authentication and strict data privacy, for government access only.
